# docs/title_map.yaml
# Canonical role families & seniority mappings for O02.
# These rules are applied to R13-normalized titles (display form).
#
# Notes:
# - Matching is case-insensitive substring (first match wins).
# - You can add as many rules as you like; keep them specific to avoid collisions.
# - role_family should be one of:
#     Executive, Founder, Sales, Marketing, Customer Success, Support, Finance,
#     Operations, Engineering, Product, Data, IT, Security, HR, Legal,
#     Design, General Management
# - seniority should be one of: C, VP, Director, Manager, IC
#
# Example:
#   "VP, Sales & Marketing" → matches "VP, Sales" rule (Sales/VP)
#   "Head of Data"          → Data/Director
#   "Chief Revenue Officer" → Sales/C
